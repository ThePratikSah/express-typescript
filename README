# Express with Typescript

I've tried creating a repo so that I can use **Express JS** with **Typescript**. If you want to create a new express project, I'd recommend you to use Typescript so that you can eliminate a lot of bugs in the development phase only.

## Installation

Use the package manager [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) to install all the required packages.

```bash
yarn install
```

## Usage

For using the repo, just clone the repo from the following link and run `yarn install`

```bash
# link to the repo
git clone https://github.com/ThePratikSah/express-typescript.git

# or
git@github.com:ThePratikSah/express-typescript.git

# change the directory
cd express-typescript

# to install the required packages
yarn install

# to start the server
yarn dev
```
